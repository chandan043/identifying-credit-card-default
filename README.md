# Identifying Credit Card Default

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of credit card default. By accurately predicting default, financial institutions can proactively manage risk, implement preventive measures, and optimize their credit strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card customers, including:

* **Demographic Information:**
  * LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit)
  * SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
  * AGE: Age in years
  * EDUCATION: Education level (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
  * MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
* **Payment History:**
  * PAY_0 to PAY_6: History of past payments, scaled and transformed
* **Amount of Bill Statement:**
  * BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in NT dollars
* **Amount of Previous Payment:**
  * PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in NT dollars
* **Default Payment Next Month:**
  * Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   * Handle missing values (if any)
   * Identify and address outliers
   * Check for inconsistencies and anomalies
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., payment-to-bill ratio)
   * Explore feature interactions and potential transformations

## Model Building and Training

1. **Model Selection:**
   * Experiment with various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
   * Consider ensemble methods to improve performance
2. **Model Training:**
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   * Train the selected model(s) on the training set
   * Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search
3. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve

## Model Deployment

1. **Model Serialization:**
   * Save the trained model for future use
2. **Deployment Platform:**
   * Deploy the model to a suitable platform (e.g., cloud-based services, web application)
3. **Integration with Financial Systems:**
   * Integrate the model with existing credit risk assessment systems

## Future Work

* **Incorporating Time Series Analysis:**
  * Analyze the temporal patterns in payment history and bill amounts to improve predictions
* **Feature Importance Analysis:**
  * Identify the most influential features to gain insights into the factors driving default
* **Explainable AI Techniques:**
  * Use techniques like SHAP or LIME to understand the model's decision-making process
* **Continuous Learning and Model Retraining:**
  * Regularly update the model with new data to adapt to changing trends and patterns

## Additional Considerations

* **Ethical Implications:**
  * Ensure fair and unbiased models, especially considering potential biases in the dataset.
* **Data Privacy and Security:**
  * Protect sensitive customer information and comply with relevant regulations.
* **Regulatory Compliance:**
  * Adhere to industry standards and regulations for credit risk assessment.

By following these guidelines and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we can build robust and reliable models to help financial institutions mitigate credit risk and make informed decisions.
